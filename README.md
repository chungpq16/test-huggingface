      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Failed**
   - Check if your API endpoint is correct
   - Verify your API key is valid
   - Ensure the model server is running

2. **Tool Not Working**
   - Tools are triggered by keywords in your message
   - Try phrases like "weather in [city]" or "calculate [expression]"

3. **Streamlit Issues**
   - Make sure you have the correct Streamlit version installed
   - Try restarting the app if it becomes unresponsive

### Testing Your API

You can test your API endpoint manually:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "max_tokens": 100,
    "temperature": 0.7
  }'
```

## Development

To extend the chatbot with additional tools:

1. Add new tool methods to the `DummyTools` class in `simple_app.py`
2. Update the `process_user_input` function to handle new keywords
3. Add documentation to this README
